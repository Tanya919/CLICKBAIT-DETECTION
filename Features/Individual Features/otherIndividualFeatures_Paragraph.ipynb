then 'purge on-demand resources when they are no longer needed and disk space is low', removing them until they are needed again.And the whole iOS 9 software has been designed to be thinner during updates, namely from 4.6GB to 1.3GB, to free up space.This app thinning applies to third-party apps created by developers.Apple doesn't say if it will apply to the apps Apple pre-installed on devices, such as Stocks, Weather and Safari - but it is likely that it will in order to make iOS 9 smaller.As an example of storage space on Apple devices, a 64GB Apple iPhone 6 is typically left with 56GB of free space after pre-installed apps, system files and software is included.A drop of 8GB, leaving 87.5 per cent of storage free.By comparison, Samsung's 64GB S6 Edge has 53.42GB of available space, and of this 9GB is listed as system memory.Although this is a total drop of almost 11GB, it equates to 83 per cent of space free.By comparison, on a 32GB S6 MailOnline found 23.86GB of space was available, with 6.62GB attributed to system memory.This is a drop of just over 8GB and leaves 75 per cent free.Samsung said it, too, had addressed complaints about bloatware and storage space with its S6 range. Previous handsets, including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Apple iPhone 5C typically ranged from between 54 per cent and 79 per cent of free space.Businessman 'killed his best friend when he crashed

the user has completed the previous level.Similarly, the app can request In-App Purchase resources only when the user buys a corresponding in-app purchase.Apple explained the operating system will then 'purge on-demand resources when they are no longer needed and disk space is low', removing them until they are needed again.And the whole iOS 9 software has been designed to be thinner during updates, namely from 4.6GB to 1.3GB, to free up space.This app thinning applies to third-party apps created by developers.Apple doesn't say if it will apply to the apps Apple pre-installed on devices, such as Stocks, Weather and Safari - but it is likely that it will in order to make iOS 9 smaller.As an example of storage space on Apple devices, a 64GB Apple iPhone 6 is typically left with 56GB of free space after pre-installed apps, system files and software is included.A drop of 8GB, leaving 87.5 per cent of storage free.By comparison, Samsung's 64GB S6 Edge has 53.42GB of available space, and of this 9GB is listed as system memory.Although this is a total drop of almost 11GB, it equates to 83 per cent of space free.By comparison, on a 32GB S6 MailOnline found 23.86GB of space was available, with 6.62GB attributed to system memory.This is a drop of just over 8GB and leaves 75 per cent free.Samsung said it, too, had addressed complaints about bloatware and storage space with its S6 range. Previous handsets, including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and Apple iPhone 5C typically ranged from between 54 per cent and 79 per cent of free space.Businessman 'killed his best friend when he crashed
