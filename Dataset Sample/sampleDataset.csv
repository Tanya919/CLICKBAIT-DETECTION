According to the report, his adviser in the Jobcentre, who knew his story, did not pick up on his situation, and it took four years before someone finally offered him the help he required.', 'The report also found that no data is collected on victims once they leave the National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – the UK’s framework for identifying victims of human trafficking and ensuring they receive protection and support – and that the recording of data that is collected was “generally substandard”.', 'The Committee said it was “unacceptable” that the Government did not monitor the re-trafficking of victims and urged that reform to the NRM must include the recording of instances where victims have been processed through the framework more than once.', 'As part of the inquiry, Baroness Butler-Sloss, Trustee of the Human Trafficking Foundation who helped draft the modern slavery bill in 2014, said the outcome of the NRM\xa0process was “nothing but a piece of paper” to victims.', '“It is an extremely unattractive anomaly and an extremely expensive process putting a person through the NRM to get a positive outcome that everybody accepts that person is the victim of an appalling crime,” she added.', '“At that stage, having spent all that money, having gone through all that process, there is no result except a piece of paper.”', 'Problems surrounding asylum rights were also noted in the report, in its findings that\xa0being\xa0a victim of slavery through the NRM confers no equivalent right to remain for any period, while\xa0recognition as a refugee grants an initial period of five years’ leave to remain in the UK.', 'The damning findings come less than a year\xa0after Theresa May announced\xa0on entering Downing Street\xa0that\xa0Britain would\xa0lead the fight against modern slavery,\xa0calling\xa0it “the greatest human rights issue of our time”, and pledging a £33m\xa0boost to coordinating\xa0the Government response to the issue.', 'The inquiry, launched at the request of the UK’s Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner after he wrote to the Committee expressing his concerns that the support for victims of modern slavery was “inadequate”, made a number of urgent\xa0recommendations.', 'It suggested that all confirmed victims of modern slavery should be given at least one year’s leave to remain with a personal plan for their recovery, which it said should act as a “social passport” to support for at least the 12-month period of leave to remain.', 'Training on how to spot signs of slavery and deal sensitively with identified victims should\xa0be greatly improved among frontline Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) staff, who are often not aware of modern slavery, the Committee said.', 'The report also urged that the Government must undertake an urgent review of the benefit support available to victims, including those who are assisting the police with investigations.', 'Kate Roberts, head of office at the Human Trafficking Foundation, welcomed the findings\xa0and said changes were “much needed” in a system that currently leaves victims of modern slavery without support and unable to unpack the trauma they’ve been subjected to.', '“It’s\xa0good to see such a detailed report that really shines a light on what happens to victims after\xa0the identification of modern slavery. I really welcome the\xa0recommendations – they are much needed,""\xa0Ms Roberts told The Independent.', '""At the moment the \'recovery period\' is actually the period during which it is being\xa0decided\xa0whether they are victims or\xa0not. I don\'t see how it is a recovery period. If\xa0there\'s\xa0so much uncertainty in your life and you\'ve come from this extreme trauma, I don\'t think you can really begin to unpack that trauma and recover when you\'ve got all the uncertainty around the corner.', ""“Until now, our whole system has just focused on the identification of victims. They go through this really quite traumatic process of having to disclose what’s happened to them and almost relive it, and then the decision is made that they are a victim and it doesn’t really make a difference. They think now they’'ll be okay because the Government believes them, but in fact\xa0it often doesn’t mean anything."", '“If these recommendations\xa0were implemented it really would change that. Many victims will take longer than a year to recover, but at least they would have time to get relevant advice\xa0and put the necessary applications in.”', 'In light of the findings,\xa0chair of the Committee\xa0Frank Field MP\xa0said: “While we applaud the leading role the UK has taken in tackling this ‘barbaric crime’, as the Prime Minister has called it, when you consider what is at stake, there is a shocking lack of awareness and co-ordination in the frontline services dealing with modern slavery.', '“What these people go through is unimaginable, and yet it is happening, here and now, and our response seems almost lackadaisical: a paper exercise earning you recognition as having been enslaved, which then entitles you to almost nothing as far as we can see.\xa0', '“We don’t even record instances where the same person is thrown back into this hell, even though that is surely the clearest sign of the failures in our response.

Long before he became a polarizing politician and president, Trump was a New York institution who participated in one of the most New York of rituals: a Friars Club roast.', 'Reviewing old YouTube clips and reports of Trump’s February 2004 roast today is like stepping into a bizarro-world, where the vicious insults lobbed at “The Donald” were nothing less than cracking wise at the expense of a New York businessman and reality-TV star.', 'The Friars Club roasts always\xa0attracted a random assortment of old-timers, TV stars, athletes, New York icons and a roster of insult comics. It was considered an honor to have all those in the room tear you to pieces, and it usually ended with kind words.', '“We always say this at the end of a roast, and we mean it so sincerely today, we only roast the ones we love,” Freddie Roman, dean of the Friars, said when\xa0introducing Trump at the conclusion of the event.', 'Though\xa0Trump participated in a more heavily produced Comedy Central celebrity roast seven years later, the Friars Club one was its grittier, untelevised precursor. Regis Philbin served as host. Also in attendance: Mike Wallace; Rev. Al Sharpton; Stone Phillips; Abe Vigoda; boxer Michael Spinks; Victoria Gotti (from reality TV/the mafia); Katie Couric; and Jeff Zucker, then head of NBC and currently the president of CNN — which, in 2017, Trump labels as “fake news.”', 'But in 2004, Trump paid tribute to Zucker as “truly\xa0great and the\xa0brilliant man behind NBC.” At the end of the roast, Trump said, “NBC, if you look at what they’ve done over the last four or five years — believe me, everybody wanted ‘The Apprentice,’ but he wanted it more and he knew it was going to work, and it did work, big league, and this is truly a great guy.”', 'The New York Times was on hand for the event, reporting that “Trump\xa0smiled and laughed along yesterday afternoon as he sat for two and a half hours in a ballroom of the New York Hilton, while a series of comics, celebrities and so-called friends absolutely savaged everything from his brushes with bankruptcy (his casinos have seen better days) to his fiancee (Melania Knauss, who is young, pretty and accented) to, yes, his infamous comb-over (just plain bizarre).”', 'Zucker had his own cracks about Trump, per the Times: “Donald, I got the invitation for the wedding, but I can’t make it. I’ll catch the next one.” He then added that the wedding would be a great affair, with a cigar room for Trump’s friends and “for Melania and her friends, a bouncy castle.”', 'When Sharpton stepped to the microphone, he said he’d asked about the diversity in the roast crowd before agreeing to participate. “They said, ‘That won’t be a problem, we’ll have has many blacks in the crowd as Donald has living in his buildings.’ ” He then added: “The truth is Donald asked me to perform one of his weddings. We fell out when he wanted me rather than\xa0read the vows, to read the prenuptials.”', 'Aside from the random celebrities were the professionals comedians who were regular presences at these roasts.

The Trump sign is like a 50-percent-off tag.” (Ross offered a few kind words at the end of his set, including: “I think you should be running for president and those other two guys should be hosting reality shows.”)', '“The reason Trump puts his name on all his buildings is so that the banks know which ones to take back,” comedian\xa0Rich Vos said, according to the Times.', 'Lisa Lampanelli, dressed as a nun, played a character: Trump’s ex-girlfriend. “He seems very happy,” she said, “with his beautiful fiancee, Insert Name Here.”', '“You know what she sees in you?” comic Susie\xa0Essman said to Trump. “A billion dollars and high cholesterol.” (According to the Times, “That was, for the record, the only joke the salty Ms. Essman told that could possibly be published in a family newspaper.”)', 'Richard Belzer referred to Trump as “the grifter wrapped in a fraud perpetuated on society.”', 'According to the Hollywood Reporter, Robert Klein highlighted Trump’s love of attention and the limelight: “He doesn’t give a s—\xa0about any of the other stuff — which involves people losing everything and going on the street with pencils in Atlantic City begging.”', 'After the\xa0roasters finished, it was Trump’s turn to take the mic.

Modernizing this state health care was a priority that Mr. Putin enshrined in decrees early in his third term as president. They set ambitious targets for medicine: Doctors’ salaries would double by 2018, the end of Mr. Putin’s term; life expectancy would rise by four years.', 'But the oil price collapse, sanctions and military spending intervened. Russia remains a poor country, albeit one with geopolitical ambitions. The average income in Russia is $642 a month, compared with $3,584 in the United States, according to government statistics in both countries.', '“We need investment, and in medicine new technology requires state investment,” Yevgeny Gontmakher, an economist and authority on the Russian health care system, said in a telephone interview.', 'In rural areas, doctors are often too scarce to find in a timely manner. Russian life expectancy for men and women, at 70.3 years, has hardly budged since Mr. Putin issued his decrees and is still 10 years lower than the European Union average of 80 years.', 'Similarly, while government-approved “vitally necessary” drugs are theoretically covered, in practice they are as likely as not to be out of stock at the state-run pharmacies that distribute them free. Left to pay out of pocket at clinics or commercial drugstores, patients gravitate toward cheaper options, like leeches.', 'Ms. Kalinicheva, a secretary in a Moscow office, said she had suffered from intolerable lower back pain before trying leeches, applied weekly at a walk-in medical center, the Hirudotherapy Clinic.', 'She said she had chosen leeches for cost savings and to avoid taking painkillers. “I wanted something natural, to minimize the chemicals,” Ms. Kalinicheva said.', 'At the clinic, Dr. Irina A. Pankova applies leeches to treat glaucoma, prostatitis, hypertension and many more ailments. She encourages patients to use them in conjunction with standard drug treatments. As they engorge themselves with blood, the leeches bulge to six to seven times their original size before dropping off. They are used only once, to avoid spreading disease.', 'On a recent day, a steady stream of patients traipsed through the door, took seats and flipped through magazines, awaiting their turn.', 'Medicinal leeches cost 90 cents each in Russia, compared with $15.50 for leeches sold by Leeches USA, a medicinal leech supplier based in Westbury, N.Y.', 'They are raised in leech farms where, in Russia, women in white laboratory coats follow a procedure little changed over the decades.', 'They set out glass jars teeming with medical leeches, or Hirudo medicinalis; a colander with a fine, porous surface; a bolt of cheesecloth; and a jug of fresh cow’s blood.', '“The leeches are hungry,” Natasha Bogdanova, an employee of the International Center for Medicinal Leeches, observed as she ladled warm blood into the cloth-lined colander.', 'It is not a job for the squeamish. At feeding time, the “leech raisers,” as they are called, plunge their hands into the glass bottles of leeches, retrieve the little bloodsuckers and put them in the blood-filled colanders.', '“I’m not afraid,” Ms. Bogdanova said with a shrug. “I’m used to it. It’s my job. A job is a job.” One leech slithered up her wrist as she spoke.', 'In Europe, the pharmaceutical giants Sanofi and AstraZeneca have marketed medicines based on leech venom, delivering the benefits without the actual creatures. In 2016, Sanofi sold 29,300 units of its leech-derived topical ointment, Exhirud Heparin, according to the company.', 'Like researchers in richer countries, scientists in the Soviet Union were trying to transform live leech therapy into pharmaceutical products in the late 1980s, said Gennady I. Nikonov, the director of the leech farm, who got his start in a laboratory at Moscow State University trying to isolate medicinal compounds from leeches.', 'The effort unraveled with the Soviet breakup and is still foundering for lack of money. Mr. Nikonov has continued the work, and his company has prospective pharmaceutical products but, like so many other areas of Russian industry, lacks investment to bring them to market. That would require expensive clinical trials.', 'And so for now the leeches are sold, squirming and hungry, in glass canning jars, waiting for their patients. It works, as it has for centuries. “Why give up the experience of past years?” Mr. Nikonov said, shrugging.', 'Mr. Nikonov estimated that Russian leech farms produce 10 million specimens a year; his farm alone accounts for about two million. The F.D.A. does not keep statistics on American leech use, a spokeswoman, Stephanie Caccomo, said, but the numbers are small.', 'Most American patients “would prefer a pill or something else without the yuck factor,” said Dr. Ronald Sherman, a former professor of medicine at the University of California, Irvine, and director of the BioTherapeutics, Education and Research Foundation.', 'Some Russians prefer to apply leeches at home. At a store run by the leech farm, Nadezhda K. Loba, 64, turned up with a plastic water jug and an order for 100 leeches. She applies them at home, on her temples, to treat conjunctivitis.', 'For an added measure of frugality, Ms. Loba noted, “you can use them repeatedly for yourself,” by departing from clinic practice and saving them after an application.', '“If you take care of them, change their water, they can be used for a long time,” she said. “Think about it: Leeches don’t run out.”']","['The New York Times', 'Basic', 'All Access', 'Home Delivery', 'A worker at the International Center for Medicinal Leeches near Moscow.

It was revealed he had three shoulder surgeries before heading to the combine. He didn’t test exceptionally well in Indianapolis, running slower than many expected. Yet, his game tape proved he’s the most natural and dangerous running back on the board. Is the lack of long speed a major issue?

It appeared his stock would plummet but I’m not wavering. I ranked him at No. 14 based on the full package, not the injury, but where he falls in this draft is anyone’s guess. I hope a team takes a chance on him because he’s more than worthy of a first-round pick when healthy.', '4. Forrest Lamp, OG/OT, Western Kentucky Top 50 Rank: 27', 'One of the strangest situations at the combine involved Lamp and his arm length. His arms were measured one inch longer at the combine than at the Senior Bowl. The difference might be enough for some team to consider keeping Lamp at tackle when everyone left the Senior Bowl thinking he was definitely a guard. There is no argument about Lamp’s impressive athleticism. He posted position bests in four of six events for offensive linemen, including 34 bench press reps.', '5.

Then the ball’s snapped and it’s clear why he’s one of the best in the nation. His athleticism is off the charts and he proved that at the combine. The 6-3, 234-pound Cunningham posted a 4.67 in the 40, a 35-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-5 broad jump. From an athletic standpoint, there are minimal issues.', '6. Obi Melifonwu, S/CB, Connecticut Top 50 Rank: 30', 'When it comes to height, weight and speed prospects, Melifonwu is front and center. He blew away the combine.

Plenty of scouts and personnel people went back to the film room to make sure his athletic gifts showed in his play on the field.', '7. Cam Robinson, OT, Alabama Top 50 Rank: 34', 'Typically, it doesn’t matter what numbers offensive linemen post at the combine, other than bench press. As long as they don’t run a Rich Eisen-like 40, they’ll be fine. The 6-6, 322-pound Robinson impressed with a 5.15 in the 40, a phenomenal time for his size.

Unfortunately, he was all over the place, sort of like his 2016 season. He was inconsistent throwing the football to receivers he didn’t know. His mechanics and his feet were more than a little askew. Apparently, he threw much better at his pro day in late March, but the results have certainly been mixed.', '9. Alvin Kamara, RB, Tennessee Top 50 Rank: 37', 'Explosiveness describes Kamara’s testing at the combine. He posted an eye-popping 39.5-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-11 broad jump and posted a satisfactory 4.56 in the 40. Overall, no real concerns were noted regarding his physical ability, but he didn’t create the buzz other top running backs did.', '10. Tim Williams, OLB, Alabama Top 50 Rank: 39', 'Williams was able to put pressure on college tackles with an explosive first step and blazing speed, so the expectations were high entering the combine. Like McKinley, he had a tough time reaching them. He ran a 4.68 in the 40, as slow as any other edge rusher at the combine. That pedestrian time, combined with average testing, raised some concerns. He looked much more comfortable, and in his element, when performing position drills on the field, which alleviated a little bit of the concern.', '11. Chidobe Awuzie, CB/nickelback, Colorado Top 50 Rank: 41', 'If the general scouting populace was unaware of Awuzie entering the combine, he certainly got their attention. He ran a 4.43 40 at 202 pounds, posted a 11-foot broad jump and registered two excellent change-of-direction drill times. Awuzie got some first-round consideration and should start immediately at nickel corner for his future NFL team.', '12.

With his speed, length and change-of-direction ability, he should stay at cornerback going forward, although there’s a consideration to return to safety in the future. King’s stock has risen throughout the entire draft process and his combine performance will certainly create more buzz.

He didn’t bench at the combine, planning to do so at his pro day, and that’s how he apparently tore his pectoral muscle. His career was marred by injuries and that history may be why he was left on the board Thursday night.', '14. Dan Feeney, OG, Indiana Top 50 Rank: 44', 'Feeney is a technician who gets little credit for how truly dominating he can be at the point of attack. He started nearly his entire career at guard but, for the last five games of the 2016 season, he moved out to right tackle when injuries struck the Hoosiers’ offensive line. He was arguably the best lineman at the Senior Bowl and is the best interior lineman in this draft class.', '15. Curtis Samuel, WR/RB/?, Ohio State Top 50 Rank: 45', 'Samuel smoked his 40, posting an official 4.31, third-fastest overall at the combine. In addition, he posted a 37-inch vertical jump. That was enough to show how dynamic and explosive he is. One team must now figure out how to best utilize him going forward, tough though that may be.', '16. Justin Evans, S, Texas A&M Top 50 Rank: 46', 'Evans decided to not test at the combine, choosing to work out at his pro day on March 29 in College Station. He did bench press 14 reps. It was a bit perplexing he didn’t test, unless there was an undisclosed injury. He also missed the Senior Bowl after practicing throughout the week.', '17. Carl Lawson, DE/OLB, Auburn Top 50 Rank: 47', 'Lawson is known for his explosive rushing ability off the edge, so it was a bit of a surprise when he registered a combine-high 35 bench press reps. What was not as surprising was his 4.19-second short shuttle time. Lawson assured teams he has what they crave in an edge rusher — power and speed. Consider those boxes checked.', '18. Teez Tabor, CB, Florida Top 50 Rank: 48', 'The 40 was thought to be the death knell for a former Gator cornerback selected in 2010 — Joe Haden. He responded by running well at his pro day and became an all-pro cornerback for the Cleveland Browns. At the combine, Tabor ran a pedestrian 4.62, which was nearly 0.3 seconds slower than first-round prospect Marshon Lattimore. He benched 225 pounds only nine times, which was concerning. It was a rough weekend that\xa0certainly impacted his draft stock.', '19. Ryan Anderson, OLB, Alabama Top 50 Rank: 49', 'Most teams knew Anderson wouldn’t shine in a format like the combine, as he’s not that type of athlete.

The 70-year-old former world No1 has already been provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation after a series of incidents in Constanta.', 'Nastase was overheard making an apparently racist comment about Serena Williams’ unborn baby as well as asking the GB captain, Anne Keothavong, for her hotel room number. During the first day, Nastase then verbally abused the chair umpire, Jaume Campistol, and the referee, Andreas Egli, before calling Keothavong and the British No1, Johanna Konta, “fucking bitches” as he was sent from the court.', 'The two-time grand slam champion was escorted from the venue by security staff and banned for the rest of the tie. He defied that by briefly returning the following day, however, and had pointedly refused to apologise in the immediate aftermath, saying he had no regrets.', 'However, Nastase, who is waiting to find out his final sanction from the ITF, has now changed tack, albeit while still claiming the events have been exaggerated. In a statement on his Facebook page, which is unverified, Nastase said: “In the last few days, my name and the unfortunate situation at the Romania vs England (sic) Fed Cup match were present in both the national and international press. I do not wish to deny the negative reactions I’ve received, but I would like to add a few words of my own to this matter now, after a period of reflection.', '“I was five when I first picked up a racket. Since then, tennis has been more than a sport or a profession for me. Tennis has been, and is, my life, and for tennis I have sacrificed almost everything, personal or professional. Unfortunately, now, in my 70s, I have somehow managed to do something I have never wanted or even imagined: to feel tennis moving further away from me.', '“The last few days have been difficult for me. My words during the Fed Cup have rightfully caused controversy and upset the audience, the press and, most painfully for me, the tennis world. I will not attempt to defend my words, but I can assure you they only stemmed from my genuine desire to defend the Romanian team and Romanian tennis.', '“I am fully aware that nothing can truly excuse my statements – not the tension of a high-stakes game, not my traditionally irreverent attitude, not the unfortunate escalation of the situation. My life remains dedicated to tennis and its audiences, so please accept my apologies, for whatever they may be worth right now.”', 'Nastase, though, again criticised Konta for complaining to Campistol about crowd noise during her match with Sorana Cirstea. It was that which sparked his foul-mouthed meltdown, with the match delayed after Konta broke down in tears.', 'The British No1 was subsequently criticised by the Romanian team for her reaction and for claiming she felt threatened by abuse from the crowd.', 'Nastase said: “What happened in Constanta has been exaggerated by all. Joanna [sic] Konta had no right to speak to the chairman [umpire], the team captain is the only one who can do this. I asked the chairman for some explanations in a civilized manner, but he sent me to the stand. In the stand, they withdrew my status as captain of the Romanian team and I became a simple spectator. After this, the referee suspended the match. I do not understand why he did it and based on what point from the regulation?”', 'Nastase was strongly rebuked by Williams for his comments about her unborn baby, with the Romanian heard to say: “Let’s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?”', 'He added: “The same problem was with the subject about Serena. I really respect Serena. She is one of the greatest tennis players of all times and I know how much work is behind these results. At that press conference, I was asked about Serena’s pregnancy. That was the first time I had heard about her pregnancy, and my reaction was spontaneous.”']",['Ilie Nastase'],"[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.6666666666]",0.33333333332,0.0,0.0,no-clickbait,0

Trump embraced the cause of fiscal responsibility and accused President Barack Obama of shackling the country with a “mountain of debt.”', 'Mr. Obama “doubled our national debt. Doubled it,” Mr. Trump claimed in a speech in Virginia Beach.', 'Then on Wednesday, Mr. Trump unveiled the outlines of his much-anticipated tax overhaul, calling for steep tax cuts with only modest offsetting revenue increases. Economists I spoke to this week estimate it would add trillions to the national debt over the next decade.', '“We’ve only done the rough numbers, but this looks like a tax cut of a magnitude of about $5 trillion,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan advocacy organization for fiscal responsibility. “That is simply unimaginable given our fiscal situation and the size of the deficit, which is already the worst since World War II.”', 'The sense of incredulity was widely shared.', '“Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady must be beside themselves in private,” said Leonard E. Burman, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, referring to the House speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee chairman. “They put in years of work on a tax reform plan that at least tried to be revenue-neutral,” meaning tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes, “and wouldn’t explode the deficit.”', 'James B. Stewart’s “Common Sense” columns have examined President Trump’s tax returns and his tax plans for America.', 'Or as Steven M. Rosenthal, a business tax expert and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, put it: “Mr. Trump’s plan basically is tax cuts for everyone. Real reform, with revenue neutrality, is difficult. There are winners and losers, but Trump apparently just wants winners.”', 'Tax cuts, as opposed to tax reform, are easy, Ms. MacGuineas agreed: “Who doesn’t love a tax cut, especially if no one has to pay for it? This is a free-lunch mentality.”', 'That Mr. Trump would embrace such a cut-now, pay-later approach probably shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, considering the Trump Organization’s reliance on borrowed money. “I’m the king of debt,” Mr. Trump said last year on CNN. “I love debt.”', 'Just how much Mr. Trump’s plan would cost the government is hard to determine, given the sketchy details. But the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation estimates that two prospective elements — reducing individual rates to three brackets of 35, 25 and 10 percent, and cutting the tax rate for corporations and pass-through entities (businesses that pay taxes at individual rates) to 15 percent — would cost the Treasury $4 trillion to $6 trillion over 10 years, said Alan Cole, an economist at the foundation.', 'The Urban-Brookings Tax Center estimated the cost of the cuts Mr. Trump proposed during the campaign at $6.2 trillion, assuming no additional growth, and just under $6 trillion when growth is factored in.', 'Mr. Trump also wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax, each of which would cost the Treasury hundreds of millions in revenue.', 'The administration’s proposal was silent on some critical aspects of any tax plan, such as the treatment of capital expenditures for business. Mr. Trump has said he strongly supports immediate expensing of capital expenditures, which many economists agree would encourage growth. The Tax Foundation estimates that such a change from current depreciation schedules would cost the Treasury $2.2 trillion over 10 years.', 'That would raise the 10-year revenue loss to well over $8 trillion.', 'Mr. Trump’s proposal did nod in the direction of raising revenue by calling for elimination of all deductions, save those for mortgage interest, charitable contributions and retirement savings. The major deduction not mentioned — and evidently jettisoned — is the one for state and local taxes. (And it’s probably no coincidence that the states that would be hit hardest, like New York and California, overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton.)', 'Mr. Cole said eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes would add about $2 trillion of revenue over 10 years.', 'But the Trump plan didn’t address other possible sources of revenue, such as eliminating the interest deduction for businesses or imposing a border tax. Both are key elements of the Republican House plan, but have drawn fierce opposition from the powerful real estate and retail lobbies.', 'The Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, suggested that the plan would “pay for itself” by bolstering economic growth and tax receipts. But no economist I spoke to this week — Republican or Democrat — said growth could compensate for an increase in the deficit of anywhere near the magnitude of $4 trillion to $6 trillion.', '“I want a plan that’s focused on growth as much as anyone,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative pro-growth advocacy group. “But these tax cuts are not going to pay for themselves. If you believe that, you’re kidding yourself.”', 'While economists debate the impact of vast additional government borrowing on debt markets, most argue it would drive up interest rates, curbing the very growth the cuts were intended to foster. “Borrowing trillions of dollars eventually shows up in financial markets,” Mr. Burman said. “It will almost certainly push up interest rates.”', 'And the effect would come at a time when the Federal Reserve is already raising interest rates, even without the impact of new federal borrowing.', '“We’re very vulnerable to higher rates,” Ms. MacGuineas said. “Every 1 percent increase in interest rates adds $160 billion a year to our existing interest payments. Interest is already the fastest-growing portion of the federal budget.”', 'She, too, argued that a big increase in federal borrowing would push up interest rates, undermining growth “or even causing negative growth.”', 'The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that when additional interest payments were included, Mr. Trump’s campaign tax proposals would add $7.2 trillion to the national debt by 2026 and $20.9 trillion by 2036.', '“The losers are future generations,” said Mr. Rosenthal — as Republicans have long argued.', 'Given the huge impact on the deficit, no one I spoke to expects Mr. Trump’s plan to be enacted without significant modifications. “I don’t think a tax cut of anywhere near this size can make it through Congress,” Ms. MacGuineas said. “There are varying degrees of commitment to getting our fiscal affairs under control among members of Congress, and there are some Republicans who only use the argument against Democrats. But there are others who are very serious about it.”', 'Mr. Holtz-Eakin agreed. “There are many Republicans who genuinely care about deficits,” he said. “They recognize that you can’t create permanent tax reform if you’re blowing up the deficit. “', 'He added: “I think this is an opening salvo. With this president, everything is a negotiation, and this is his opening bid.”', 'Even that prospect is worrisome, Ms. MacGuineas said. “These numbers are so huge, they almost lose meaning,” she said. “You start negotiating about adding $5 trillion to the deficit and $1 trillion starts to sound reasonable. But that shouldn’t even be on the table without a plan to get the deficit under control.”']","['The New York Times', 'Basic', 'All Access', 'Home Delivery', 'President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven T.

While the statutory rate on large businesses may be 35 percent, a\xa0Government Accountability Office study\xa0found last year that large U.S. corporations paid an average 14 percent on their income from 2008 to 2012.

If the U.S. corporate rate were 15 percent, which would make it one of the world's lowest, that would be a big incentive to bring the cash home, thus yielding more tax revenue."", 'The administration is mulling a one-time repatriation levy of 10 percent to sweeten the pot.\xa0', 'Perhaps that would translate into a bigger tax haul from big business. Corporations contributed just 9 percent of total federal revenue in 2016. In times past, they gave a lot more: In the mid-1960s, it was\xa0over 20 percent.

The president has more than 500 pass-through entities that contain his real estate holdings.\xa0"", 'Big winners: wealthy individual taxpayers, less so for others.\xa0While details are thus far sparse, most Americans would benefit \xa0from the Trump plan, with some doing better than others. Namely, the rich. The administration aims to make taxes less onerous on citizens, both in terms of how much they pay and the difficulty of figuring out tax returns.', ""Tax brackets would shrink to three from seven. Rates, which now range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, would be a less-burdensome 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. A big help to lower-income taxpayers would be the doubling of the standard deduction -- what people take who don't itemize -- to $24,000.\xa0"", ""However, what the administration's tax plan would actually do for individuals is unclear without more specifics. An analysis of Mr. Trump's campaign tax plan last year by the Tax Foundation found that the top 1 percent of the population (earning $469,550 and up) would gain $135,460 on average, while a middle-income earner ($48,652 to $88,147) would garner $1,174."", 'The removal of the 3.8 percent tax on investment income, enacted to help pay for Obamacare, is a boon to wealthier investors. Other than that surcharge, capital gains and dividends are taxed at a 20 percent rate.', 'The administration also wants to cancel the estate tax, which affects the amount over $5.49 million that an individual passes along to heirs. Now, every dollar below that is tax-free. Mr. Trump would make all of it exempt from taxation.', ""Also helping the better-off is Mr. Trump's call for axing the alternative minimum tax, launched in the 1960s to ensure that loophole-using rich people paid something. It does this by severely limiting deductions. Because the AMT wasn't indexed to inflation, it now affects households making as little as $200,000, meaning the upper middle-class and no longer just the mega-wealthy.\xa0"", ""But big-money folks like the president would benefit the most if the AMT goes away. That's judging by Mr. Trump's 2005 tax return, a portion of which came to light recently from an unknown source. Because he had huge losses from real estate investments, which he deducted, Mr. Trump would have paid next to nothing ordinarily. But due to the AMT, because it ignores most deductions, he ended up paying at the 24 percent rate, which is still far below the top rate. Take away the AMT, and he needn't worry about that. \xa0"", 'Possible losers: future taxpayers. Treasury Secretary\xa0Mnuchin contended that the plan ""will pay for itself with growth."" In other words, the tax cuts would stimulate economic activity that would generate extra tax income and make up for the shortfalls from lower rates.', ""There's a longstanding debate over whether that is true, which goes all the way back to Ronald Reagan's 1981 cut. The deficit ballooned under Reagan, but the economy also expanded -- and other influences were at work, such as the squelching of double-digit inflation by the Federal Reserve, which makes clean cause-and-effect analyses difficult."", '""We\'re very good shape on tax reform,"" President Trump said on Tuesday. But there\'s still a central hurdle, and it has to do with Trump himself. ...', ""Would better growth help out at all? Most likely, but not to the extent Mnuchin envisions. Just a third of the cost of tax cuts is recouped because of more rapid economic growth, by the reckoning of Gregory Mankiw, who headed the President's Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush."", 'If so, that means an even larger federal debt because Washington would have to sell more bonds to make up for the diminished revenue. ""Unfortunately, it seems the administration is using economic growth like magic beans -- the cheap solution to all our problems,"" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan watchdog group. ""But there is no golden goose at the top of the tax cut beanstalk, just mountains of debt.""', ""Right now, the debt held by the public is 77 percent of GDP. MacGuineas' organization projects that will reach 150 percent by 2050 under current law. And the Trump plan would make it far worse, she said, adding trillions to the $2 trillion in debt already on the books.\xa0"", 'That conceivably could thwart needed federal spending to fight recessions or wars, and it could crowd out investments in job-creating private enterprise, as everyone would be buying presumably safer Treasury bonds. And to be sure, the government under this scenario would have to hike taxes radically to pay for everything.', ""Of course, whether anything close to this plan can or will be passed is problematical, in light of the dynamics of Congress and the ferocity of special-interest lobbyists to protect or even improve their clients' special tax breaks. Cohn and Mnuchin said many of the details had to be hashed out with lawmakers, and what they presented was more of a framework."", '""This was not based on a lot of study, but on what could be passed,"" said Michael Greenwald, a partner at the Friedman LLP tax consulting firm.\xa0', 'And how long it will take is yet another question.

In Japan and the far east, it is used as a skin whitener. But now a very large study of 20,000 women in 21 countries has shown it can stop a third of cases of bleeding to death after giving birth.', 'Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries. “It is not only the women dying – it is the impact on the child that has to grow up without a mother, children who might already be in the family and the husband,” said associate professor Haleema Shakur from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the trial.', '“This is of absolutely huge importance. While a single mother is dying, we need to keep fighting for them.”', 'The drug has already been proven to cut the death toll from bleeding after accidents in a trial of similar size. The latest trial, published in the Lancet medical journal, recruited more than 20,000 women who either gave birth in one of 193 hospitals involved or managed to get there after starting to bleed. They were randomly assigned either tranexamic acid or a placebo.', 'The researchers found that tranexamic acid was most effective when it was given soon after the bleeding began. The trial was originally intended also to find out whether the drug saved women from having to undergo a hysterectomy – the removal of the womb. But the scientists discovered that in many countries, where anaemia is common and blood supplies are limited, surgeons operated immediately as the surest way to save the woman’s life.', 'If all women who haemorrhage after childbirth were given the drug, the trial suggests that 30,000 lives could be saved a year. In practice, that will be more difficult. Tranexamic acid was given in an intravenous injection in the hospitals, as the quickest way to have an effect. Many women give birth at home and may not get to a hospital in time.', '“It is available in the form of a tablet for heavy periods, but absorption may take too long,” said Shakur. They are now working on new ways to get it rapidly into women’s systems – perhaps as an injection in the arm muscle or as a capsule under the tongue. It is also possible that women deemed to be at high risk of haemorrhage could be given a tablet before they give birth. The trials have shown no side-effects, making the drug very safe.', 'Of the two-thirds of women who died in spite of being given the drug, Shakur said some arrived at hospital too late, while others had underlying illness including severe malaria and anaemia which may have been the cause of death.', 'It has taken a long time to show that the drug does work in the context it was designed for. Professor Ian Roberts from the London School, who co-led the study, said: “The researchers who invented tranexamic acid more than 50 years ago hoped it would reduce deaths from postpartum haemorrhage, but they couldn’t persuade obstetricians at the time to conduct a trial. Now we finally have these results that we hope can help save women’s lives around the world.”', 'There are many next steps, said Shakur. “We have to make sure tranexamic acid is available wherever a woman gives birth and is at risk,” she said. “We must make sure doctors and midwives are aware of the results of the study. And we need health ministers to make sure that the drug is available in their country and is on their shopping list of essential medicines.”']","['Haemorrhage after childbirth kills 100,000 women a year, mostly in low and middle-income countries.

The standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly will jump from $12,700 to approximately $24,000, “so that a married couple will not have to pay taxes on the first $24,000 it earns,” said Cohn', 'Continue Reading Below', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'Additionally Trump’s tax package would eliminate all benefits on the personal side with the exception of retirement savings, charitable giving and mortgage interest.', 'The White House plan also would eliminate the alternative-minimum tax and the “death tax” (aka estate tax), but Cohn refused to comment on the status of the marriage penalty under the proposal.', 'Three Tax Brackets', 'The new proposal calls for the collapse of the current seven-tier bracket system to just three brackets, with a decrease in the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent. Previous floated proposals had the top rate at 33 percent. The administration aims to set the other two tax rates at 25 percent and 10 percent, the latter down from an initial 12 percent proposal.', 'While critics have accused the administration of looking to give tax relief to the rich, this revised proposal would be a smaller-than-expected break for the richest Americans in the country.

That’s why we are one of the least competitive countries in the corporate world when it comes to the corporate tax,” Cohn said.', 'The administration also proposed cutting the corporate tax rate by twenty percentage points, from 35 percent to 15 percent and switching it from a worldwide taxation system to a territorial one.', 'A territorial taxation process taxes only the income earned by a company within the specific country. The intention of this switch is to drive investment back into the country and stop companies from moving their headquarters overseas to avoid the burden of heavy American tariffs.', 'While the administration insists the tax reform package will pay for itself, creating “trillions of dollars of additional revenues,” the cut in the corporate tax rate alone could cost the country $2.1 trillion through the year 2026, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.', 'Click the button below to comment on this article.', 'Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

At the outset, he acknowledged to his fans that this was “a completely different experience than what you’ve had in the past.”', '“I was very surprised how it all turned out,” Mr. O’Reilly said of his forced exit last week from Fox News. “I can’t say a lot because there’s much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I’m very confident the truth will come out. And when it does — I don’t know if you’re going to be surprised, but I think you’re going to be shaken, as I am.”', 'Mr. O’Reilly said that he would record a current-events podcast on his subscription-based website, airing four nights a week, that he hoped would soon develop “into a genuine news program.” But he demurred on offering further details about his abrupt removal from the air.', '“I can’t say any more because I just don’t want to influence the flow of the information, O.K.?” Mr. O’Reilly said. “I don’t want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. You, as a loyal O’Reilly listener, have a right to know, down the lane, what exactly happened and we are working in that direction.”', 'The re-emergence of Mr. O’Reilly, who was vacationing in Italy when Fox decided to dismiss him last Wednesday, came an hour before his successor at 8 p.m., Tucker Carlson, made his on-air debut in the time slot.', 'In a direct address to viewers, Mr. Carlson called himself a devoted O’Reilly fan who “marveled at how prepared he was, how tough he was, and how crisply and directly he expressed his views.”', '“What O’Reilly did was not easy,” Mr. Carlson said, just before the opening credits rolled. “He set a high bar. I’m going to do my best to meet it. Thanks for sticking with us.”', 'Mr. Carlson’s debut marked a crucial first test of Fox News’s hastily revamped prime-time lineup. The ensemble show “The Five” was moved from the afternoon to the 9 p.m. slot, featuring a new co-host, Jesse Watters, a former O’Reilly protégé.', 'Inside Fox News, there is still widespread unease about what the abrupt exit of Mr. O’Reilly means for the network. Without Mr. O’Reilly on the air, ratings at 8 p.m. last week dipped nearly 30 percent from his average for the first three months of the year.', 'The network was also hit on Monday with a new lawsuit from a former anchor, Andrea Tantaros, who claimed that senior executives at Fox News spied on her and created an online campaign to harass her. The network denied all wrongdoing.', 'In a brief statement on the day he was let go, Mr. O’Reilly praised his former employer, and he restated that sentiment again Monday night. “Look, I was there for 20 years and six months,” he said on his podcast. “That vehicle was fabulous for me, and I said in the beginning that I’m sad, but why wouldn’t I wish them the best? They were there, we performed well for them, and that’s the fact.”', 'The podcast featured no guests, graphics or blaring headlines, and Mr. O’Reilly’s usual I-know-best tone seemed softened, even plaintive at times. But elements of the usual O’Reilly attitude broke through.', 'He promoted his new book, “Old School: Life in the Sane Lane,” and talked up a planned national tour, listing four separate cities where he would soon be appearing (“Plenty of good seats remain”). He bashed the mainstream media, defended President Trump, and threw in a dig at Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, saying she “could never get elected anywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.”', 'Back at Fox News, the pressure is on. Mr. O’Reilly was the linchpin of its evening lineup, with a loyal following that swelled to nearly 4 million viewers a night earlier this year. It was his best-ever viewership — and a bountiful lead-in for his fellow anchors.', 'But last week, with Mr. O’Reilly off the network, ratings fell.', 'Network executives pointed out that, even without Mr. O’Reilly, “The Factor” was still attracting slightly more viewers than the year before. Still, last Friday’s “Factor” drew 2.84 million viewers, less than that day’s 5 p.m. edition of “The Five” and a 6 p.m. airing of Bret Baier’s “Special Report,” according to Nielsen data.', 'Concerns about the treatment of women at the network also remain.', 'Ms. Tantaros, a host who left the network last year, filed her lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday.', 'Among the listed defendants were Fox News’s former chairman, Roger E. Ailes, and several senior-level executives at the company, including its co-president, Bill Shine.', 'This is Ms. Tantaros’s third lawsuit involving her tenure at Fox News. She sued Mr. Ailes and the network last year, saying that Mr. Ailes had sexually harassed her; that suit is currently in arbitration. She filed a separate suit last week in the State Supreme Court of New York, claiming that Fox News tried to undermine her credibility by instigating a derogatory Twitter post about her.', 'Monday’s lawsuit states that Fox News hacked into Ms. Tantaros’s digital devices and eavesdropped on her phone calls, as retaliation for her claims against Mr. Ailes. Ms. Tantaros says in the suit that a fleet of anonymous social media accounts, known as “sock puppets,” used the information to send her subtle and disconcerting signals that she was being watched.', '“The key question here is whether the Murdochs are serious when they say they want to usher in a new era at Fox,” said Judd Burstein, Ms. Tantaros’s lawyer.', 'The network vigorously denied the accusations in a statement from its outside counsel, Dechert.', 'Fox News executives “have no knowledge of the anonymous or pseudonymous tweets described,” the statement said. “This lawsuit is a flimsy pretext to keep Ms. Tantaros and her sexual harassment claims in the public eye.”', 'Susan Estrich, a lawyer for Mr. Ailes, dismissed the new lawsuit as meritless and “an obvious attempt to get publicity,” adding: “The courts and the parties should not be burdened by repeated filings such as this.”']","['The New York Times', 'Basic', 'All Access', 'Home Delivery', 'Bill O’Reilly’s first public comments since his departure from Fox came on the day his successor, Tucker Carlson, made his on-air debut in the 8 p.m. time slot.

If you want to learn about the country music superstar Dolly Parton, you’d better come prepared.', 'A course called Dolly’s America at the University of Tennessee’s main campus in Knoxville is devoted to the life story of Ms. Parton, who hails from nearby Sevier County in the eastern part of the state.', 'But this is much more than a surface-level study of a popular musician, said Lynn Sacco, the associate professor who teaches the course. It’s a thesis seminar meant for history students in the honors program, and it’s meant to give students a new way of understanding Appalachia’s modern history and Ms. Parton’s role in it.', '“It’s really kind of a nerdy class,” Dr. Sacco said.', 'The second thing you need to know is that for many natives of eastern Tennessee, Ms. Parton, 71, is known for much, much more than just music. She is an icon for a place that outsiders can sometimes underestimate, said Carson Hollingsworth, the student body president at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.', '“I think there are some stereotypes associated with the area, especially in rural Appalachia,” he said. “I think it’s great that we have a figure like Dolly Parton who comes from the area and is able to shed light on it and be an ambassador.”', 'The course, which was taught for the first time last year and will be taught again in the fall, gained attention when Ms. Parton herself tweeted about it last week.', ""From the girl voted in High School 'least likely to succeed' this sure is a blessing! https://t.co/3EnB8ixB4f"", 'Through her representatives, Ms. Parton declined an interview.', 'According to Dr. Sacco’s syllabus, the seminar looks at a history of the 20th century not from the vantage point of elites, but through the eyes of Ms. Parton, “a poor white girl born in midcentury Appalachia.”', 'It has a wealth of reading materials, including Ms. Parton’s own 1994 book, “Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business,” and a slew of contemporary articles from periodicals such as The Tennessee Magazine, The Knoxville News Sentinel and The New York Times. Their topics range from child labor in the early 20th century to the Kennedy-era Appalachian Regional Commission and modern economic anxiety in the region.', 'What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.', 'The syllabus also includes plenty of videos of historic footage from YouTube.', 'Ms. Parton, born to a poor family in Sevier County in 1946, was only a child when she started singing at local television and radio stations. She moved to Nashville right after high school to pursue a music career. In 1974, she scored four number one hits on the Billboard country chart – including “Jolene” and “I Will Always Love You” — and she hasn’t stopped, winning awards, for singing, songwriting and acting, that include Kennedy Center Honors in 2006 and a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 2011.', 'Dr. Sacco, who is from Chicago and moved to Tennessee in 2004, said she was struck by the ardor of Ms. Parton’s fan base in Tennessee. “She is beloved here,” she said. “If she would run for governor, no one would oppose her.”', 'Ms. Parton’s Dollywood theme park, about an hour’s drive from the Knoxville campus, is a popular attraction in the region, pulling millions of visitors annually to the Smoky Mountains. “You want to feel like you’re doing something good,” Ms. Parton said to The Tennessean during a 2015 visit to the park. “I really feel proud as a citizen of this area, and just being a daughter of the hills here.”', 'The university, in particular, has close ties to the country star: It awarded her an honorary doctoral degree in 2009.', 'During that ceremony, she took the stage in a sparkling, tasseled pink dress to perform songs and to give a commencement speech. “I’m very grateful for my life, but if I had but one wish for you, it would be for you to dream more,” she said.', 'Then Ms. Parton changed into a tailor-made, figure-hugging black robe to accept her honorary degree.', 'Ms. Parton is also known for her philanthropic work. Some call her “The Book Lady” for her program, called Imagination Library, which distributes free books through the mail to children.', 'As recently as December, she hosted a three-hour telethon to raise millions of dollars after a wildfire raged through Sevier County, killing 14. Ms. Parton promised $1,000 a month, for up to six months, to families displaced by the blaze.', '“She did a lot of work with relief efforts here,” said Mr. Hollingsworth. “I’m not a big fan of country music, but I’m a big fan of her.”', 'The university said 87 percent of its undergraduate population is from Tennessee. “Using pop culture as a way to talk about how to use history sources was actually the goal of the course,” Dr. Sacco said.', '“But the personal part is for students to see that history is not just about dead presidents. It’s one way for them to tie in a lot of personal feelings about coming from East Tennessee, from Appalachia.”']","['The New York Times', 'Basic', 'All Access', 'Home Delivery', 'Dolly Parton at a country music convention in 1972.

Daily Kos, a liberal website that raises money for lesser-known Democratic candidates, pulled its endorsement of Mello this week after discovering his history on the issue, and NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue slammed the DNC for adding him to its cross-country unity tour.', '“The actions today by the DNC to embrace and support a candidate for office who will strip women — one of the most critical constituencies for the party — of our basic rights and freedom is not only disappointing, it is politically stupid,” Hogue said in a statement.\xa0', 'Perez initially defended the DNC’s acceptance of an anti-abortion Democrat.\xa0', '“Our job at the DNC is to help Democrats who have garnered support from voters in their community cross the finish line and win ― from school board to Senate,” Perez said. “The biggest threat to women’s reproductive rights is the relentless Republican attacks on women’s health care, including legal, accessible abortion services. And I won’t let anyone get in the way of our fight to protect a woman’s right to choose.”', 'But Perez changed course Friday and delivered a big victory to the reproductive rights movement, saying that he “fundamentally disagree[s] with Heath Mello’s personal beliefs about women’s reproductive health” and that “every candidate who runs as a Democrat should do the same, because every woman should be able to make her own health choices. Period.”\xa0', 'Perez’s statement will likely alienate some high-profile anti-abortion Democrats in the party, including Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards and Sens. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Edwards said at the Democratic National Convention in 2016 that the party might be more successful in the Deep South if it allowed more anti-abortion candidates to rise in the ranks.\xa0', '“It’s hard to remain a big-tent party if you have a very small platform,” he said. “We have to make our voices heard.”', 'Reproductive rights advocates agree with Perez that the party must stand firm on the issue. Hogue celebrated the victory for the movement on Friday.\xa0', '“Kudos to Chair Tom Perez and the DNC for recognizing that we are a stronger party when we stand for our core values,” she said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “Women across the country who are, and have always been, the heart and soul of the Party, are breathing a sigh of relief to know that the DNC has our backs, and we look forward to a day when we don’t have to fight this fight again.”', 'Share this slide:']","['The Huffington Post', 'The Huffington Post', 'HuffPost']","[0.0, 0.0, 0.3333333333, 0.6666666666, 1.0]",0.3999999999799999,0.3333333333,0.0,no-clickbait,0

Given that yeast thrives in warm moist environments, sitting around in your sweaty, tight-fighting gym clothes can increase your chances of getting an itchy yeast infection, says Minkin. Which, no thanks.', ""On the subject of yeast infections, they can be treated with over-the-counter medication like Monistat. HOWEVER, if you fall into a pattern of getting them and treating it with OTC meds multiple times, it might be time to go to the doctor, says Minkin, because you might not actually have a yeast infection.'Of the women who self-treat for a yeast infection, about a third of them actually have it,' says Minkin. 'But a third will have another type of vaginitis, and a third will have some sort of irritative phenomenon, like a response to a condom or a wash they're using.'So if you're not getting relief, check with your doctor to find out what's really going on."", ""SERIOUSLY, FRONT TO BACK, PEOPLE. This is a case of please don't get fecal matter into your sensitive vagina and vulva. But on another note, the type of toilet paper you use could be causing you some irritation — specifically thin, abrasive, dyed, or scented TP. So stick with white, soft, unscented paper, and your vulva will be a happy camper."", ""Meaning, you might not be properly lubricated for penetration. And a dry vagina during sex = an unhappy, uncomfortable one. Or worse, one with abraded or torn tissue. 'Lubrication to a vagina is analogous to an erection to a penis,' says Minkin. Meaning, you should be adequately stimulated and lubricated from foreplay before moving forward."", ""THAT SAID, there's nothing wrong with using lube, whether because you deal with vaginal dryness or because you just like extra lubrication when you're getting down. But if you're using lube, make sure to find one that works for you, which might take a little bit of experimentation. 'Never get the giant economy size on your first go because you want to make sure you’re not sensitive to it,' says Minkin. 'A lot of lubes have preservatives or scents or other things your vagina might not like. So I always say to get a small size first, make sure you’re comfortable with it.'"", ""Most vagina trends fall on a spectrum of 'unnecessary' (like vajacials) to 'potentially harmful' (like steaming). Basically, unless you're having any health problems, you don't need to take any extra steps to take care of your vagina, says Ross. Look here for more information about what gynecologists think of common vagina trends you've probably seen around."", ""Kegels are exercises that strengthen your pelvic floor — aka the muscles that support your bladder, uterus, and intestines. And you're never too old or young to benefit from them, says Minkin. Pelvic floor strength is important for not leaking urine (which most people will do at some point in their lives), and it can even increase sexual sensation in your vagina.Find out how to do Kegels here."", 'Instagram', ""Obviously, your dull razor isn't going to do much to upset your vagina, but it could irritate your vulva a lot, and that's just plain uncomfortable. Ross suggests changing your blade every two weeks or so: 'Otherwise, there will be a lot of unwanted bacteria that can cause razor burn or bumps or acne and other irritation to the skin and hair.'"", ""To avoid irritation of the vulva skin (which, again, is super sensitive), you'll want to exfoliate gently with a warm, wet washcloth, BuzzFeed Health previously reported. That helps remove any dead skin cells and makes sure that when the wax is applied, there’s maximum wax-to-hair contact, rather than the surrounding skin. Which, ouch. Also, you'll want to wear loose-fitting clothing and avoid having sex for 24 hours after your wax — otherwise you're looking at a lot of irritation."", 'Instagram']","[0.0, 0.6666666666, 0.6666666666, 1.0, 1.0]",0.66666666664,0.6666666666,0.6666666666,clickbait,1

Then Comes Marriage? ,A new study reveals that the app’s users are more likely than offline daters to be looking for committed relationships. And they say “I love you” more often.,"Online Dating,Dating and Relationships,Tinder (Mobile App)","['For some of us, the dating app Tinder suggests a slot machine for sex, a game for singles featuring one too many bathroom selfies.', 'For Casey Napolitano, a real estate agent in Los Angeles, Tinder is synonymous with love.', 'Ms. Napolitano met her husband, John Napolitano, on the app during her first and only Tinder date. She “swiped right” on a photo of John in a tuxedo giving a speech at a wedding. “It just really turned me on,” she said. Six months later, they bought a house together; a few months later, they were engaged. They have been married for two years now and have a 14-month-old. “Our baby girl is perfect,” the proud new father said.', 'The Napolitanos’ love story isn’t isolated. According to Jessica Carbino, Tinder’s on-site sociologist who pores over Tinder’s data, more people than ever are committing to relationships thanks to the app, which will have its fifth anniversary in September.', 'In a report released this week, Tinder conducted two surveys comparing its users with offline daters. (The offline daters fell into three groups: people who have never dated online, people who had dated online in the past but no longer did, and people who had never used online dating but were open to the possibility.)', 'According to Ms. Carbino, the findings indicate that Tinder users are more likely to be looking for a committed relationship than are offline daters. She said that the surveys revealed that Tinder users were doing a better job than offline daters of signaling “investment in prospective daters” by asking them questions when originally contacting them, and that they are 5 percent more likely to say “I love you” to their partners in the first year of dating.', 'The survey also reveals that while 30 percent of men who are not dating online say it is “challenging to commit,” only 9 percent of male Tinder users say they find it difficult to maintain a committed relationship. The results were roughly similar for women.', 'Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.', '“When you are dating online, you actually have a very clear idea of what the marketplace is like,” Ms. Carbino said. “You are able to have a visual idea of the pool in front of you, whereas the people who aren’t dating online are simply speculating as to what the pool may be like.”', 'The report looked at a survey administered via the app to 7,072 Tinder users, ages 18 to 36, and a second survey of 2,502 offline daters, ages 18 to 35, conducted by Morar Consulting.', 'While the surveys were commissioned by Tinder, Ms. Carbino said her position as a social scientist was to provide a valid and realistic view of the world. “The realistic view might not provide what the company wants,” she said, “however it’s my responsibility to do so and provide data that is accurate.”', 'It is unclear whether the surveys sampled similar and representative demographics, a fact that Jennifer Lundquist, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst who researches online dating, said indicated that more studies were needed to determine if Tinder’s surveys were accurate.', '“One issue with the non-online dating comparison group is that given how normalized and destigmatized online dating has become for this age group, it’s unusual not to participate in online dating,” Professor Lundquist said. As a result, she said, the offline daters “may be a weirdly skewed group, or as sociologists would say negatively select.”', 'Professor Lundquist also questioned the motivations for the survey, pointing to the anecdotal belief among many daters that Tinder’s picture-based feature leads it to be a “hookup” app rather than a mechanism for finding long-term partners. “It seems like Tinder is trying to work on their image with this survey,” she said.', 'But despite Tinder’s aims, and researchers’ varying methods, the app’s conclusions about the desire of online daters to commit may not be unfounded. In a 2012 report on a study by the sociologists Michael Rosenfeld and Reuben J. Thomas published in the American Sociological Review, the researchers found that couples who meet online are no more likely to break up than couples who meet offline. Mr. Rosenfeld’s continuing research at Stanford University concludes that couples who meet online transition to marriage more quickly than those who meet offline. (The cohort of couples he studied met in 2009, before Tinder was founded; he is currently gathering data that include users of the app.)', 'Still, it is unclear whether Tinder’s surveys, even bolstered by larger trends in online dating, will shift the public’s perception of the app. It does not help that in a recent article in The California Sunday Magazine, Tinder’s founder and chairman, Sean Rad, admitted to sexting with Snapchat users. But perhaps Ms. Carbino, who scours Tinder daily, sees what others can’t: humans trying their best to connect. She is single and said she had found, and lost, love on Tinder.', 'An earlier version of this article misstated Sean Rad’s role at Tinder.

More than six million people there are in need of immediate assistance, with half of them facing famine.', 'British officials in Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, said that the effort was “unprecedented”. The UN target of raising $835m (£654m) has largely been met, raising hopes that a repeat of the tragedy of the 2011 famine, which killed 250,000 people in the country, will be averted. However, aid workers in Somalia warn that any significant offensive, especially if accompanied by the use of air power, could have a devastating effect on relief operations.', '“Increased belligerence from some international and national actors is not going to help us … if things deteriorate as a result of military effort, that will be man-made,” said Peter de Clercq, the United Nations’ deputy special representative of the secretary-general in Somalia. “We have argued very strongly that this is not the time for military action.”', 'Other senior aid officials spoke of a “nightmare scenario” of widespread fighting in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. “It would be a catastrophe … and could totally undermine everything that is being done to save lives,” said one official, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of his organisation’s operations in the country.', 'But Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, the newly elected president of Somalia, and President Donald Trump have both signalled an imminent offensive against al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group allied to al-Qaida that controls much of the region worst hit by the drought.', 'Mohamed, a dual US-Somali national, pledged earlier this month to deliver on his campaign promise to rid his country of the group. At a press conference last month, he offered an amnesty to al-Shabaab militants who surrendered within 60 days, but warned the rest would “face the consequences … a new war”. Trump recently designated the country a “zone of active hostilities”, allowing commanders greater authority when launching airstrikes, broadening the range of possible targets and relaxing restrictions on the use of air power designed to prevent civilian casualties.', 'Ministers said that Mohamed’s decision to launch renewed action against al-Shabaab had been taken after talks with Washington.', '“There has been close consultation with the two countries and our president has called a state of war,” said Abdirahman Yarisow, the Somali information minister. “We are very serious about trying to carry out military operations to wipe out al-Shabaab from the country. It is do-able, but needs lots of resources, commitment from our friends and allies, and discipline.”', 'Trump has also authorised the deployment of regular US forces to Somalia for the first time since 1994. The US in effect pulled out of Somalia after 1993, when two helicopters were shot down in Mogadishu and the bodies of American soldiers were dragged through the streets.', 'The US president has said that defeating radical Islamist terror groups is the “highest priority” of his administration, and that the US “will pursue aggressive joint and coalition military operations when necessary”.', 'Al-Shabaab has not been implicated in any plots to strike the US or Europe, but has carried out several high-profile terror attacks in the region and has attracted recruits from the US as well as Europe. Even before he took power, Trump’s advisers asked State Department officials dealing with east Africa why, after years of effort, the war against al-Shabaab had not been “won”.', 'Mohamed has promised voters he would wipe out the movement within two years. Yarisow said: “All this … will give us an opportunity with our allies and friends to really target al-Shabaab from the air, and for our federal forces and [the regional military forces in Somalia] to take advantage.”', 'Millions of those needing emergency assistance to avoid starvation live in areas controlled by al-Shabaab. These zones are likely to bear the brunt of any new fighting. The timing of military action is likely to concern some US allies, too. Senior officials in Britain’s Department for International Development and the Foreign Office favour low-level negotiations with al-Shabaab to allow access to drought-hit areas, minutes of recent meetings seen by the Observer show. This would almost certainly be jeopardised by any serious fighting.', 'Violence is already a major obstacle to humanitarian relief in Somalia, with more than 100 killed in terrorist attacks in Mogadishu this year, and daily ambushes of government or international forces by al-Shabaab. Last week aid workers from the World Food Programme and the United Arab Emirates were targeted in two separate attacks on the outskirts of the capital.', 'More than 50 al-Shabaab fighters were reported killed last month by Kenyan troops deployed in Somalia as part of Amisom, a regional stabilisation force of about 22,000 men.', 'Al-Shabaab, which does not allow most western organisations to enter territory it controls, dismissed the amnesty as a “fraud designed to please the west” and has promised to meet any offensive “with redoubled force”. The group currently allows people to leave its area of control to seek medical assistance, food and shelter – but there are fears that this could change.', '“At the moment al-Shabaab is allowing freedom of movement, but the declaration of war was very badly timed. It may change the dynamic. The mortality rate could be massive,” said another aid official, who runs operations in Somalia for a major international NGO. “Our original hope and expectation was of a ceasefire. That would have given us a vital two to three months to reach two to three million people living in areas that are inaccessible.”', 'An offensive would be likely to rely heavily on US air power and possibly special forces. Military and counterterrorism advisers have been present in Somalia for several years, working with local forces. A small unit of special forces has participated in raids on al-Shabaab.', 'Such troops would play a vital role in any renewed fighting. The Amisom stabilisation force has shown little appetite for major operations against al-Shabaab in recent years and has suffered significant casualties in attacks by the group.', 'The US has steadily intensified its war in Somalia. According to data compiled by the thinktank New America, there have been 41 strikes by US forces in Somalia since 2003, with al-Shabaab a target since 2008. The number of drone strikes has risen sharply since 2015.

It needs to be a top priority of this administration and this Congress to fix it … You’ve seen all these attacks take place. It’s not a hypothetical.”"", 'He cited two recent examples of cyber-attacks U.S. officials suspect were carried out by North Korea. In 2014, a group calling themselves the Guardians of Peace hacked Sony Pictures Entertainment, delaying the release of The Interview, a comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that depicted a fictional assassination attempt on Kim Jong-Un. In the following days, the hackers released proprietary information and embarrassing emails, costing the studio millions of dollars.', 'In 2016, hackers stole $81 million of Bangladeshi funds from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through the SWIFT network, a financial messaging service used by thousands of banks around the world. According to The New York Times, U.S. officials are investigating whether North Korea was involved because the hackers used a piece of code that also appeared in the cyber-attack on Sony.', 'The North Korean government has denied any hacking allegations, but the Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky released a report earlier this month linking the hacker group “Lazarus” to both the Sony and SWIFT attacks and tracking “Lazarus” back to an IP address in North Korea.', 'In January, President Donald Trump pledged to appoint a team to deliver a plan to address U.S. cybersecurity vulnerabilities within 90 days of his inauguration, but Carlin noted that deadline has come and gone without a plan or a team in place.', ""“I can't think of a more urgent problem facing this administration, but as of yet we haven't heard what their strategy will be,” Carlin said. “I hope that it goes to the top of their agenda.”"", 'A senior administration official declined to comment on when the president’s cybersecurity plan might be made public but told ABC News that, despite reports to the contrary, a “fully functional” cybersecurity team led by White House National Security Council cybersecurity coordinator Robert Joyce is already in place. Related efforts spearheaded by Jared Kushner and Rudy Giuliani are also underway, the official said, but it is Joyce who will set cybersecurity priorities.', 'The official acknowledged, however, that the government has “a long way to go” when it comes to cybersecurity, citing vulnerabilities in some federal networks.', '“There are over 200 departments and agencies and they’re not all equipped to do cybersecurity right,” the official said. “Nobody would be credible if they claimed anything different.”', 'Those vulnerabilities could be exploited by foreign hackers. A cyber brigade is easier to develop than a traditional fighting force, even for a country with extremely poor network infrastructure. North Korea only made its first known connection to the Internet in 2010, and access remains tightly controlled by the government and limited to only a select group of citizens. As a result, Internet use in North Korea is among the lowest in the world, with only about 14,000 Internet users in the country in 2016, according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) within the United Nations.', ""An extensive report on North Korea's cyber capabilities compiled in 2014 by the technology firm HP determined that North Korea’s poor connectivity hasn’t stopped its government from building a team of so-called “cyber warriors.” Defectors say the regime identifies schoolchildren who show promise in mathematics, sends prospects to elite academies for rigorous computer science training and eventually recruits successful students into a cyber operations branch of the military. These “cyber warriors,” HP says, are some of the only North Koreans with access to the Internet."", '""If they\'re going on the offensive, cyber makes a lot of sense for them,"" said Martyn Williams of 38 North, who specializes in coverage of North Korea\'s technological capabilities. ""Some of those things you see in the parades look scary, but they don\'t have the resources to match the weaponry of the United States or South Korea. When it comes to cyber, it\'s much easier to become a formidable opponent, so it\'s a much more even playing field.""', ""The exact size of the force, which is spread out among several different units overseen by the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) within the General Staff Department of the Korean People's Army, is unknown, but a South Korean government analysis also conducted in 2014 estimated that the force could include nearly 6,000 soldiers, many of whom operate in foreign countries to hide their activity. The HP report pinpointed the location of one group, for example, called Unit 121, which is believed to have launched attacks on “enemy networks” in both the United States and South Korea from China, not far from the North Korean border."", 'John Bambenek of Fidelis Cybersecurity, who frequently consults for U.S. government agencies, says that many U.S. institutions, most notably banks, are also unprepared to defend themselves against a hostile intelligence service.', '“Would they be able to compromise the CIA? No,” Bambenek said. ”But I think they could certainly go after soft target.”', 'Cyber thefts from financial institutions could bring security concerns about North Korea full circle, raising the question of whether North Korea might be pouring those allegedly stolen funds into its missile program.', 'Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow specializing in North Korea at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy, says these alleged heists could be part of a new strategy to circumvent the international sanctions designed to cripple the missile program.', '“North Korea has a long history of engaging illicit activities to acquire funds for its nuclear missile program, which they see it as key to the regime’s survival,” Ruggiero said. “As we squeeze more and are more successful, they may turn to illicit activities more.

It’s been a wild two years since then. Jenner introduced Caitlyn\xa0to the world when she appeared on the cover of\xa0Vanity Fair, had her continuing evolution documented in a reality series on E!, and oscillated between being a champion for and a force against the very community she considered herself a part of. To put it gently, Jenner’s journey as an unofficial spokesperson of the trans community has not been smooth.', 'Now, several days before the release of her new memoir called The Secrets of My Life,\xa0Caitlyn Jenner\xa0and Sawyer have reunited, taking it back to where it all began. Where does Jenner, 67, see herself now, two years later? Here’s what we learned.', '1. She doesn’t regret saying goodbye to Bruce. The first question Jenner faced? How she feels two years after coming out. “Happy, peaceful, peace in my soul… all of that confusion has left me,” said Jenner. When Sawyer pressed her further, asking if there was ever any doubt in her mind about embracing her feminine side, she insisted there was none.', '“I did the right thing,” Jenner stated, noting that she doesn’t miss Bruce at all. “Not even close!” she laughed, adding that when she was Bruce, she’d look in the mirror and feel anxious. But as Caitlyn? “I’m excited about the day. For so many years, I isolated myself — I couldn’t care less about the next day. Now I do.”', '2. She uses her public outings as a way to change the narrative around the trans community — and lets it continue to change her, too. Sawyer followed Jenner on a trip to the grocery store, where she was swamped with well-wishers and selfie-seekers. Jenner explained she uses\xa0these encounters as an opportunity to make friends and give them a positive experience. “This may be their only encounter with a trans person, and I want it to be a good one,” Jenner said, adding she sometimes takes up to 40 selfies in a day. Still, she wonders what her fans are really thinking.', '“I had a guy actually ask me for a selfie, and he said, ‘Bruce, can you give me a selfie?’ Nobody has called me that in two years,” Jenner recounted. “I looked at him and said, ‘No problem.’ I want him to walk away saying, ‘Caitlyn Jenner is so nice,’ that trans people are approachable, and they’re a vital part of our society.”', '3. She’d pose for that Vanity Fair cover all over again. According to 20/20, Jenner’s Vanity Fair cover was seen by over 3\xa0billion people around the world — and she’d gladly slip into that bustier again, even though some members of her family thought “it was a little too much.”', '“From my standpoint, I had suffered for 65 years, OK?” Jenner said. “To have a beautiful shot of my authentic self was important, and the shock value.” When asked if that was intentional, Jenner admitted it was, but not for the reasons we might think. “I wanted to end the old Bruce, my old life — and that picture did it.”', 'Caitlyn Jenner poses for Annie Leibovitz on the cover of Vanity Fair #CallMeCaitlyn http://t.co/NRyh6R09RR pic.twitter.com/GO1ZgJJKBR', '— VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) June 1, 2015', '4. She’s still not sure what her peers thought of her at the ESPY Awards. When Jenner attended the 2015 ESPY Awards to accept the Arthur Ashe Award for Courage, she did so in front of 6,000 people, many of whom were athletic superstars\xa0like LeBron James and Derek Jeter. And even though she had the full support of her family behind her, she was uncomfortable about her appearance.', '“These are my peers — I’d been to the ESPYs plenty of times, I was scared to go,” she said, adding that she was sure everyone was thinking, “What a freak!', '“And I still wonder about that,” Jenner continued. “Some guys can accept it, some guys can’t.”', 'So what got her through the night? Thinking about the thousands of transgender people who are bullied every day… and how 40% of the community attempts suicide at some point in their life.', '5. She often wore a bra and panties under Bruce’s suits — and put it in her will that she wanted to be buried in women’s clothing. Bruce Jenner frequently gave motivational speeches to corporations, where he’d tell the audience things like, “Dare to take risks” and “Life has got to be an adventure, or it’s nothing.” Jenner can still recite the sayings verbatim today, but admitted to Sawyer she often wore a bra and panties under her suits.', '“I had my little suit on, I would walk off the stage and I would feel like a liar,” she confessed. And though she had started taking female hormones years ago and quit, she still had it put in her will that she wanted to be dressed in women’s clothing for her funeral.', '“If I go, when I’m buried… yeah, I want to be dressed as her, because that’s the way I was going to heaven,” Jenner said quietly, then with a little smirk added, “Yeah, I’d kind of shock everyone when they came to see the casket.”', '6. She’s still optimistic about changing the world, but is a little more realistic about it — and the role she plays. When Caitlyn Jenner first stepped into the public eye and started speaking out about LGBTQ rights, the more controversial she became — largely because of her views surrounding the LGBTQ community. Those views, along with her political stance, didn’t sit quite right with the LGBTQ crowd. As Jenner put it, “I was hoping then — there was a lot of hope there. Have I in the last two years had a bigger dose of reality? Absolutely.”', 'There’s no denying Jenner’s influence has had a positive effect —\xa020/20 points out that thanks to Jenner’s bravery, the number of people who publicly identify as transgender has jumped from 700,000 to an estimated 1.4 million. But when Jenner came out, she’d never met another transgender person. So how could she possibly become a spokesperson for a group of people who\xa0were so far removed from who she was?', '“I feel it and I see it,” Jenner told Sawyer. “At the beginning of this whole thing, yes, I knew absolutely nothing. Yes, I made mistakes. On some subjects I was insensitive because honestly, I didn’t know any better. It’s tough to take 65 years of being Bruce, and then, like, [snaps her fingers] overnight everything changes. At first you don’t know how to handle it.”', '7. She’s no longer a fan of Donald Trump. It’s no secret Jenner is Republican and that she voted for Donald Trump, but it seems like her allegiance may have changed — at least where Trump is concerned. When Sawyer asked her about it, Jenner said, “This administration for me was extremely, extremely disappointing. Here’s the deal breaker with the Republican party. And the deal breaker is, you mess with my community, I’m coming after you.”', 'As Jenner said in previous clips shared on Good Morning America, “When it comes to all equality issues, for the entire LGBT community, what we need is federal guidance. Just like the previous administration said that it was OK to serve as a trans person in the military. We have frontline people, OK? I’m talking Marines, trans guys, on the frontline, fighting for our country. I’m trying to get, especially the Republican party, to make a change.”', 'When Sawyer pressed her on the issue, Jenner admitted she went to Trump’s inauguration, and revealed he invited her to play golf with him when they chatted at a cocktail party. “At the time I thought it was a pretty good idea but since Title IX, it’s not a good idea. And so I won’t be playing golf with him.”', '8. She has no regrets about gender reassignment surgery — and doesn’t want to ever talk about it again. While taking female hormones helped to quiet her inner chatter and dissipate her depression, Jenner admits she’s lucky she had the money to change her appearance, altering her jawline, forehead, and breasts. Now that she’s one of the 12% of trans women who get gender reassignment surgery, she wrote about its success and how liberating it was in her new book, but insists it didn’t change who she was before or after she had it.', '“I wasn’t less of a woman the day before I had the surgery than I was the day after I had the surgery, because that did not define who I am as a human being,” Jenner stated, adding she has no regrets. However, she says it’s a subject people shouldn’t ask about.', '“This book is about honesty, but that doesn’t mean that in the future that I have to talk about it — that I’m going to dwell,” she said. “The media may, but I am not going to dwell on that subject. And I would make a suggestion to all people out there, don’t ask the question. It’s not an appropriate question to ask any trans person.”', '9. She regrets not being a better parent to her children. Jenner (who has six biological children) shared family videos and pictures with Sawyer, before she confessed, “I lived about two hills over here, and I kind of dropped out of society, and I also dropped out as a parent.” Her kids Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, and Brody didn’t see her for about a decade before she popped up on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and\xa0noted that while some remain close, others are a bit more distant. “I have to admit I have to sit here and wonder, is it because of me transitioning or is it because their life is so busy that they don’t call all the time?” Jenner asked. “But every parent goes through that.”', 'Still, Jenner can admit\xa0her failings as a parent, and points to her absence as the reason why God may take issue with her when her time is up. “This is a lesson for every parent — children can accept when you change your gender, but they’ll never forget all the times dad wasn’t there. There’s no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems you have. No excuse for that.”', 'And though they were present for her first interview with Sawyer, the Jenner kids declined to be interviewed this time around, sharing only this statement: “We love our father and have deep admiration for her bravery. Every family has unique milestones, but we can honestly say Caitlyn’s gender transition has brought our family closer.”', '10. She and Kris Kardashian don’t talk that often. Sounds like any friendliness between the exes is now gone. When Sawyer asks Jenner what her relationships are like with her ex-wives, she simply said, “Do I talk to obviously the last one, Kris, all the time? No, she’s obviously moved on. I’ve certainly moved on. But we’re fine with each other.”', '11. She doesn’t see a companion in her future. When Jenner’s older sister Pam joined in on the fun, she said she wants to see Caitlyn in a relationship… but Caitlyn isn’t so sure. “I honestly do not see dating in my future,” she admitted. “I have not been approached, I’ve never been out on a date. I just have a lot of friends.”', 'When Sawyer tells her that doesn’t heal loneliness, Jenner tells her, “My life revolves around my kids, and they’ll be in my life until the day I die.”', '12. She’s a closet hoarder. Jenner took Sawyer on a tour of her closet, and\xa0pulled out clothes that were reminiscent of her history. “I can’t get rid of it because it represents something from my past,” she confessed. When Sawyer teased her for her vast collection of sunglasses, Jenner slipped\xa0on a particular pair with a smile. “These are very old. I think actually… I stole these from Kris — a long time ago.”', '13. She doesn’t believe trans acceptance will be achieved in this lifetime. Now that she’s come through the fire of two very public years of her transition journey, Jenner told Sawyer she wants to focus on raising money for her charity and fighting for transgender rights, focusing on helping trans women of color who face terrible unemployment rates. When asked\xa0if we’ll see equality for trans people in either of their lifetimes, Jenner isn’t optimistic.', '“No, I don’t think we’ll ever see full acceptance,” she replied. “Is it going to get better? I hope so. And I hope that I’m part of that. I want to fight this fight. And I’m playing in the fourth quarter of life. And I don’t have that many years left.”', '14. She believes her dad would be proud of her. Though her father and brother have long since passed, Jenner dedicated her book to the two of them. Why? “They’re the only two in my family who have never heard this story,” she says. And even though she thinks her father would have trouble with her coming out as transgender, she still believes he’d come to accept her and knows he’s proud of her.', '“I’m sure he’s looking down on me watching all of this,” she said. “He’s buried in Arlington Cemetery in Washington, D.C., there with all his army buddies, looking down and saying, ‘Go Caitlyn!’”', 'Jenner’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life, comes out Tuesday, April 25.', 'Read more from Yahoo Celebrity:', '• Gwyneth Paltrow’s Hosting a Goop Health Summit — and You Can Attend for Just $500 • Top Shots of the Week • Let Sofía Vergara Teach You How to Get On a Pool Float in 4 Easy Steps', 'Caitlyn Jenner Reveals the Time Kendall and Kylie Caught Bruce Dressed as a Woman: ‘Oh My God, What’s on the Computer Screen?!’', 'Caitlyn Jenner Reveals She’s Had Gender Reassignment Surgery in New Memoir', 'Social Snaps: Week of April 16, 2017', 'Revelations from Inside the Case Against Tad Cummins, Accused of Abducting Student Elizabeth Thomas', '(Un)Official Celebrity Stoner Quiz: Who Said It?', 'Top Shots (Week of April 16, 2017)', 'Jessica Simpson’s Family Photos: Party of Four!', 'Mel B Sued by Nanny for Defamation', ""We Found All of the Best Celebrity Instagrams From Coachella So You Don't Have to"", 'Celebrity Kids Meet the Easter Bunny: 2017 Edition', 'Social Snaps: Week of April 9, 2017', 'Kim Kardashian Sizzles In Diamond Bikini', 'What Comedians Watch When They Want to Laugh', 'Top Shots (Week of April 9, 2017)', 'See Celebs Cuddling Cute Puppies on #NationalPetDay', 'How Patton Oswalt Marked the 1-Year Anniversary of Wife’s Death', 'Celebrities Show Love for Their Siblings on National Siblings Day', 'Celebrity Spring Break Beach Bodies of 2017', 'This Is Her: Mandy Moore’s Best Childhood Throwbacks', ""'Caught Red-Handed Vandalizing a Refrigerator': Clinton Aide Sarcastically Captions Happy Photos of Hillary on the Campaign Trail to Rebut New Book"", 'Kristen Stewart’s 27 Best Quotes on Life and Love on Her 27th Birthday', 'Instacram: Lea Michele Takes on Napa Valley Wine Country', ""North Carolina Mom of Four Who Died After Complaining of Severe Migraine 'Was Superwoman,' Says Daughter"", 'Paris Jackson Bonds with Godfather Macaulay Culkin -- in Bunny Ears!', 'New Documentary Trailer Highlights Wrestler Chyna’s Final Months: ‘I Went From a Billion Dollar Commodity to on the Street’']","['Caitlyn Jenner will not be golfing with Donald Trump.', 'Caitlyn Jenner will not be golfing with Donald Trump.', ""Caitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner attend the 2015 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show."", ""Caitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner attend the 2015 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show."", 'Caitlyn Jenner will not be golfing with Donald Trump.

The mother of four has been smoking marijuana recreationally since she was 21 but didn’t learn of its medicinal benefits until years later when she was battling cancer. She’s been a proponent of the herb ever since.', '“It seems that our society is kind of having a crisis of technology, a crisis in our belief in our own health, and that something outside of it is going to make us better,” Etheridge, 55, tells Yahoo as part of our special report, “Weed & the American Family.”', 'In 2004, Etheridge was diagnosed with breast cancer, and over the next year, she underwent a lumpectomy plus five rounds of chemo and radiation. It was then that she discovered cannabis as a medicinal aid thanks to singer and close friend David Crosby.', '“I asked many of my friends [who had gone through chemo], ‘What’s the experience? What are you doing?’ And my friend David Crosby, he was the first one who said, ‘You know, Melissa, you have to do medicinal marijuana. You have to [try] cannabis. That’s the way to do it. It’s too hard otherwise,’” Etheridge recalls. Doctors initially tried to prescribe for her a steroid, a pain reliever — in total about “five, six pharmaceuticals” — but she declined.', '“I’m like, ‘No, I’m going to go this natural way,’” she explains, laughing, “I’m gonna go with this one plant that [the] side effect is euphoria. I think I’m OK with that when I’m on chemo!”', 'This wasn’t Etheridge’s first encounter with weed, as she had smoked occasionally for fun, but “not regularly” since she was 21 years old. “I was not a drinker, and it was just my choice of relaxation,” she shares. However, after her first round of chemo, the activist’s view on marijuana was forever changed.', '“It was a wake-up call for me,” she declares. “When I used it as medicine, it became so clear to me that it has been maligned and misunderstood, and I really wanted to help people who are suffering. I mean, going through chemotherapy is suffering… and cannabis helps so many parts of just that. That’s just the beginning of what it does medicinally.”', 'She continues, “I smoked to be normal. I smoked to be out of pain. I smoked to lighten myself because you’re poisoning yourself with chemo. It wasn’t about being high; it wasn’t at all anything like that. It was just being to a place where I could communicate with my children, to where I could get up, to where I could eat, where I didn’t have to go to the hospital. It was great medicine.”', 'Etheridge is cancer-free today, but she’s not cannabis-free.', '“Let’s be clear, I’m still smoking,” she laughs. “Cannabis is a part of my life. When I started my new life with my new health, it was very important to me to maintain the healthful benefits that cannabis gave you.”', 'For the acclaimed singer, those benefits include easing stress, feeling balanced, getting a good night’s sleep… and having some killer date nights.', '“Oh, cannabis is the best marital aid,” Etheridge notes. “It is good medicine for a relationship.”', 'Etheridge wed wife Linda Wallem in 2014 after four years of dating,\xa0but they have been friends for nearly two decades.', '“Let’s get personal here,” Etheridge says. “There are certain strains [of weed] — you get a nice indica on a Friday night when it’s date night, and it takes down your inhibitions. Your sexual desires are enhanced. I recommend this for relationships.”', 'So when is it time to light up in the Etheridge-Wallem household?', '“I would say normally right around when the kids are going to bed,” Etheridge reveals. “That’s sort of how it ends up. When the family’s there, once everybody gets to sleep, it’s our time. It’s Mama time…\xa0We take a bath every night and smoke, talk, wind down, and sleep a very, very good night’s sleep.”', 'Etheridge adds, “Now, when I don’t have my children — I share custody with my ex — that’s different. We’ll smoke before dinner, and we, you know, will enjoy that.”', 'The singer has four children from two prior relationships. She has daughter Bailey Jean, 20, and son Beckett, 18, with former partner Julie Cypher (both fathered by David Crosby). She’s also mother to 11-year-old twins, daughter Johnnie Rose and son Miller Steven, with ex Tammy Lynn Michaels (via anonymous sperm donor).', '“My family, all four of my children, understand cannabis…\xa0they call it medicine,” she says. “I don’t smoke in front of them, but they have certainly walked in and caught me at times, you know, back in my porch and smoking… and they ask, ‘Is that cigarettes?’ And I have to be very, very clear with them that it’s not cigarettes. There’s a difference between cigarettes and cannabis. Yes, this is a smoke, but cannabis is medicine, and they completely understand cannabis is medicine. There’s no need to hide it. It’s normalized at home.', '“My children completely take what I say as true… and when I hold [a joint] without shame or confusion, then they can understand it, as simple as if I was pointing to a bottle of Percocet and said, ‘That’s Mama’s medicine,’” she explains. “This is medicine, and they see an herb and they see that’s where my medicine is. I treat it just as any other medicine in the house, just as a bottle of vodka would be, you know, ‘This is for Mom; you don’t [try] this. When you’re grownups you can deal with that.’”', 'Etheridge’s two oldest kids, Bailey Jean and Beckett, have a clearer understanding of marijuana, given their age. They’ve even smoked with their mom.', '“It was strange,” Etheridge laughs. “It was funny at first, and then they realized it’s very natural [at the] end of the day. It brings you closer. I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink.”', 'The musician firmly believes that if you take the naughtiness out of smoking, then it won’t be something kids will run to.', '“There’s a funny thing that people take on, especially grownups, because of how we were raised with this stigma that cannabis is for hippies that wanna check out and drop out,” she notes. “My parents [said] that weed, that pot was the worst thing. They were drinking, but don’t you dare smoke that pot. I’m not judging that. That’s absolutely a path. Cannabis, in this go-getting world, is good medicine. We are turning to alcohol, we are turning to opioids… cannabis is the one that’s not gonna hurt your liver. It’s not gonna kill you. You overdose cannabis, you fall asleep!”', 'While eight states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for recreational use, more than half of the states have legalized medicinal use of it. However, Etheridge knows that shattering the stigma surrounding cannabis is still an uphill battle.', '“The fear that surrounds cannabis comes from 70, 80 years of constant misinformation,” she states.', 'Etheridge got involved campaigning for the cannabis industry years ago and will be rolling out her own line of product from Etheridge Farms later this year. While her household is a modern, pro-cannabis American family, the Grammy winner hopes others will open their minds to the good that marijuana can bring.', '“I would hope that in the future, 10 years from now, that there would be households that felt this was a holistic choice, or at the very least, not have a fear of what a plant medicine can do with your body and the benefits that you can have,” she muses. “Health is a civil right… I liken the cannabis revolution to the same-sex marriage because there was just so much fear involved.
